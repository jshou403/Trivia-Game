[Parameters/GamePlay]
After clicking the start button, a question and four possible answers will be displayed. The player has 30 seconds to make a choice. After making a selection or allowing the timer to run out, the correct answer will be displayed on the following screen for a few seconds. Then, the next question and possible answers will appear with a timer counting down from 30 seconds. This will repeat until all ten questions have run through and the final screen will display the user's score.

[MyComments]
My focus for this game was to use as much Javascript as possible. This game may not be the best approach in terms of code length and page load time - what this may be I'm still unsure and am learning. This game, for me, was to use Javascript as much as possible to my best ability, within the time frame given for the project.
